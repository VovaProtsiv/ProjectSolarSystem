        Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earths orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.</td><td>fuck you bitch</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Venus.jpg,/images/resources/Venus2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=2&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=2&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=2&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Earth</td><td>365.2</td><td>12.756</td><td>9.8</td><td>true</td><td>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite.

        Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times.</td><td>Earths axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Earth.jpg,/images/resources/Earth2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=3&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=3&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=3&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Mars</td><td>687.0</td><td>6792.0</td><td>3.7</td><td>true</td><td>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the Red Planet. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.</td><td>Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

        The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,[20][21] similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Mars.jpg,/images/resources/Mars2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=4&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=4&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=4&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Jupiter</td><td>4331.0</td><td>142.984</td><td>23.1</td><td>true</td><td>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.

        Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.</td><td>When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planets shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator).</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Jupiter.jpg,/images/resources/Jupiter2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=5&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=5&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=5&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Saturn</td><td>10.747</td><td>120.536</td><td>9.0</td><td>true</td><td>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.</td><td>Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (?) represents the gods sickle.

        Saturns interior is most likely composed of a core of iron?nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.

        An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturns planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earths, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturns larger size.</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Saturn.jpg,/images/resources/Saturn2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=6&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=6&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=6&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Uranus</td><td>30.589</td><td>51.118</td><td>8.7</td><td>true</td><td>Uranus (from the Latin name ?ranus for the Greek god ???????) is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.</td><td>For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants.

        Uranus atmosphere is similar to Jupiters and Saturns in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Uranus.jpg,/images/resources/Uranus2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=7&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=7&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=7&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Neptune</td><td>59.8</td><td>49.528</td><td>11.0</td><td>true</td><td>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.</td><td>Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 au (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi).

        It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ?, a stylised version of the god Neptunes trident.</td><td>en</td><td>/images/resources/Neptune.jpg,/images/resources/Neptune2.jpg,</td><td><a href="updatePlanetShortAdm?id=8&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT SHORT</a></td><td><a href="updatePlanetFullAdm?id=8&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">EDIT FULL</a></td><td><a href="/deletePlanetAdm?id=8&amp;loginEmail=AdminFirst@admin.com&amp;loginPassword=admin1234">DELETE</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
